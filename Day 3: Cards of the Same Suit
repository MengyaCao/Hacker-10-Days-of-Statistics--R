Task
You draw  cards from a standard -card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

1 / 156
1 / 39
12 / 39
12 / 51

answer  12 / 51

--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 13 cards of each suit. Draw one card. It can be anything with probability of 1. 
Now there are 51 cards left and 12 of them are the same suit as the first card you drew. 
So the chance the second card matches the 1st is 12/51.
